### Lession 1:  Object-Oriented Javascript

1 - **Objects in Depth**
Objects in JavaScript encapsulate both data and functionality. You'll create, access, and modify objects to build a solid foundation for object-oriented programming.

2 - **Functions at Runtime**
Functions are one of most important data structures. Learn what a "first-class function định nghĩa hàm như biến vd : có thể gán" is, learn about scope, dig into **closures**, and use immediately-invoked function expressions for private state.

3 - **Classes (Prototypal Inheritance: Subclasses) and Objects**
Creating objects individually isn't sustainable. Learn how to create similar objects with ease using Classes. You'll also learn how object inheritance works through Prototypal Inheritance. (**Object.assign() / Object.create()**)

### Lession 2 : Function Programing

- **Functional programming** - a programming paradigm that keeps the processing within functions. **Note**: This will be expanded upon in the following lesson.
- **Lambda Calculus** - a mathematical idea that any computation - any program - can be expressed as a function or set of functions.

- **Programming Paradigm** - An overarching approach or style to problem-solving or ...

> A philosophy, style, or general approach to writing code.
> 
- **Pure Functions** - A function that will always return the same output if given the same input, and which has no side effects.
- **Side effects** - An effect on your overall program from running a function, that did not come from the return statement of that function.
- **Immutable** - Unchanging. Immutable values are ones which, once declared, cannot be changed.

**Higher-Order Function** - In JavaScript, is a function that takes another function as an argument or returns another function

**Persistent Data Structures**

- data structures that store all versions of a variable and allow you to go back and edit previous versions

**Partially Persistent Data Structures**

- data structures that store all versions of a variable, but only allow you to view previous versions

### Lession 3 : Asynchronous Programming with JavaScript

- For a refresher on callbacks, here's a good article: **[Async JavaScript: From Callbacks, to Promises, to Async/Await](https://tylermcginnis.com/async-javascript-from-callbacks-to-promises-to-async-await/)**.
- For a refresher on JavaScript events, AJAX requests, and the Browser API - read chapters 13 - 15 of **[Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)**.
- To get a glimpse of where we're going, take a look at MDN's **[Introduction to Asynchronous Programming](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Introducing)**.
